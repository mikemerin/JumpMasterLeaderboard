This is an API for the fangame I Wanna Be the Jump Master, storing user information and scores for leaderboards.

# To be added:

* * Leaderboards
* click on an individual run

* * Routes
* Set up routes for each score

# Small bugs to fix

* Top: stack if window width < 1200
* * popup scrolls on fixed datacontainer, may need to use hideOnScroll
