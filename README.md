# README

This is an API for the fangame I Wanna Be the Jump Master, storing user information and scores for leaderboards.

This site was built with React.js, React Chart.js 2, and Semantic-UI-React.

# To be added:

* Stack if window width < 1200
* Leaderboard Run info will highlight current PBs or WRs in the run

# Unfixable for now

* Leaderboard not as compact, semantic-ui-react selectable bug on their end
* popup scrolls on fixed datacontainer, may need to use hideOnScroll
