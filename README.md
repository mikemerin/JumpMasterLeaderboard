# README

This is an API for the fangame I Wanna Be the Jump Master, storing user information and scores for leaderboards.

# To be added:

* larger icon for modal
* Stack if window width < 1200
* About page (as modal)

* Add comparing data, dataContainer needs to update for it (will happen through new routes)
* Search turns into “back” as context.router.history.push.last?
*  * OR button switches to “back to user” and “back to all runs”

# Unfixable for now

* Leaderboard not as compact, semantic-ui-react selectable bug on their end
* popup scrolls on fixed datacontainer, may need to use hideOnScroll
